<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aditya Raghuvanshi, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at SRM University. At 18 years old, I am passionate about technology and eager to explore the world of AI. As a first-year student, I am still getting familiar with many technical concepts, but I am always excited to learn and improve. My goal is to develop a strong understanding of AI and its real-world applications, so I can contribute meaningfully to this ever-evolving field.  

  Outside of academics, I love traveling, playing chess, and spending time with my family and friends. Traveling allows me to experience new places, cultures, and perspectives, which helps me grow as a person. Chess has always been a favorite of mine because it challenges my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. No matter how busy I get, I always make time for the people who matter to me, as I believe that relationships and personal experiences are just as important as academic achievements.  
  
  I come from Meerut, India, and I have always been determined to push myself beyond my limits. I actively participate in hackathons to gain hands-on experience and challenge myself with real-world problems. While I may not be an expert in technical jargon yet, I am motivated to keep learning and improving every day. With a strong passion for AI and ML, I am excited to see where this journey takes me and how I can contribute to the field in the future.</p>
